Club frequently asked questions
================================

Q: What are the "Club enrollment questions?"

A: Currently we have 3 questions set up that club members need to answer that deal with how their information is shared with other members of the club.  They are:

    * Do you want your name shared with other members other than the club leader and library staff?
    * Do you want your e-mail address shared with other members other than the club leader and library staff?
    * Do you want your phone number shared with other members other than the club leader and library staff?

    If a patron answers "No" to any of these questions, that information for that patron will not appear on report 3335 - "GHW - CLUB Membership roster for club use"

Q: Why can't a patron leave some clubs through the OPAC?

A: If a club is set up to disallow self-enrollment, self-dis-enrollment is also disallowed.  Currently this is the way that the software works.

Q: How do I know when someone quits a club via the OPAC?

A: If a patron quits a club through the OPAC, their dis-enrollment is recorded and a report can be written that shows this information (in progress).  If a patron quits a club that is solely staff managed, there is no record kept that the patron was ever a member of the club, so no data can be retrieved.

-----

Q: Can a patron edit their club settings?

A: No.  Currently the only way to change the answers to a patron's enrollment questions is to dis-enroll them from the club and then re-enroll them in the same club.

Q: What happens if a patron's home library changes?

A: Don't know - need to find out [TODO].

-----

Q: When you place a request for a club, what order are the requests placed in?

A: The requests should be randomized.

-----

Q: Is there a way to make the requests go to differnet libraries?

A: When you place a request for a club, the default pickup location is the location you're currently logged in at.  You can select a different library for **all** of the requests to go to.  Currently there is no way to tell the system to send some requests to one library and other requests to another library.

-----

Q: Is there a way to bulk-add patrons to a club?

A: No.  Not at the present.
